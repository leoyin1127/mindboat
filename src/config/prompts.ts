Transform this user task into a magical sailing destination:

Task: "{task}"

Return a JSON object with:
- destinationName: A creative, inspiring destination name (preferably in Chinese, but English is fine)
- description: A poetic 2-sentence description of this place
- relatedApps: Array of 3-5 relevant applications/websites that would be used for this task
- colorTheme: A hex color that represents this destination

Examples:
- Task: "Write research paper" → "学术大陆" (Academic Continent)
- Task: "Learn piano" → "艺术琴泉" (Artistic Piano Springs)  
- Task: "Build app" → "代码峡湾" (Code Fjords)

Make it magical and inspiring while being practical. Focus on creating a sense of adventure and purpose.

 * - Change sensitivity levels
 * - Add specific behaviors to look for
 * - Adjust for different work environments
 */

Analyze this camera image to determine if the user is present and appears focused on their work.

Look for:
1. Is there a person visible in the image?
2. Is the person facing toward the camera/screen (indicating they're looking at their work)?
3. Are they in a focused posture (sitting upright, attention on screen)?
4. Are there obvious signs of distraction (looking away, talking on phone, etc.)?

Current user goal: "{userGoal}"
Current task: "{currentTask}"

Return a JSON response with:

  "confidenceLevel": number (0-100),
  "observations": "Brief description of what you see",
  "distractionIndicators": ["list", "of", "any", "distraction", "signs"]

Be practical and avoid false positives. Brief moments of looking away or adjusting position are normal.

 * 
 * You can modify this to:
 * - Add specific websites/apps to always consider as distracting
 * - Adjust relevance criteria
 * - Handle specific work contexts better
 */
export const SCREENSHOT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
Analyze this screenshot to determine if the current screen content is relevant to the user's work goal.

IMPORTANT: This screenshot may include both the main screen content AND a camera view (typically shown as a small video window). Please analyze BOTH:
1. The main screen content for work relevance
2. The camera view to check if the user is present and appears focused on their work

User's overall goal: "{userGoal}"
Current task/destination: "{currentTask}"
Related apps for this task: {relatedApps}

Look for in the MAIN SCREEN:
1. Are they using applications/websites related to their task?
2. Is the visible content relevant to their goal?
3. Are there signs of distraction (social media, entertainment, unrelated browsing)?
4. Is this a productive work environment?

Look for in the CAMERA VIEW (if present):
1. Is there a person visible in the camera view?
2. Is the person facing toward the camera/screen (indicating they're looking at their work)?
3. Are they in a focused posture (sitting upright, attention on screen)?
4. Are there obvious signs of distraction (looking away, talking on phone, using mobile device, etc.)?

Common distracting patterns to watch for:
- Social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Video streaming (YouTube videos unrelated to work, Netflix, etc.)
- Online shopping
- News sites (unless research-related)
- Gaming websites/applications
- Messaging apps used excessively
- User not present in camera view when they should be working
- User looking at phone/mobile device instead of screen
- User facing away from screen or appearing distracted in camera view

Return a JSON response with:
{
  "contentRelevant": boolean,
  "confidenceLevel": number (0-100),
  "detectedApps": ["list", "of", "visible", "apps/sites"],
  "distractionLevel": "none" | "mild" | "moderate" | "high",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your assessment for both main screen and camera view",
  "suggestedAction": "continue" | "gentle_reminder" | "intervention_needed",

Be practical - brief moments of checking messages, looking up references, or adjusting position are normal parts of work.
